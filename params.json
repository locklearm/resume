The relevent portion of the project is contained [here](https://github.com/locklearm/resume/tree/master/FujitsuAPI/FujistuRESTAPI).\r\n\r\n### [Speech Driven Android App](https://github.com/locklearm/resume/tree/master/WolfWear)\r\n\r\nCredit for this project is shared with two others - one is currently a PH.D candidate at NCSU, and the other was hired by IBM Watson.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of this project can be found in [this subdirectory](https://github.com/locklearm/resume/tree/master/WolfWear/app/src/main/java/edu/ncsu/csc/wolfwear).\r\n\r\n### [Jeopardy! Web Scraper & Data Analysis](https://github.com/locklearm/resume/tree/master/Jeopardy)\r\n\r\nThis was a quickie project I threw together in a few hours one Sunday afternoon (it was never intended to be particularly reusable or maintainable).  I needed to collect some data for a statistics project, and then do a little bit of manipulation/analysis of that data.\r\n\r\n### [Source Control Data Mining For AAIT Analysis](https://github.com/locklearm/resume/tree/master/FaultBench)\r\n\r\nThis is the latest version I have of a research project I was working on with [Dr. Sarah Heckman](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/sesmith5/) aimed at developing a benchmarking tool for comparison of static analysis alert prioritization techniques (it's a mouthful, I know).","google":"UA-58390452-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
